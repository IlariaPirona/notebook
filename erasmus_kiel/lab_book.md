# 02/07/2019
* 12 am: I prepared 1L of M9 medium whith Anuradha, who prepared another 1L 
* 3 pm: streaked *P. fluorescens* SBW25 with Anuradha from the stock at -80°C in position IIIA3-29
	* I streked 1 LB plate and 1 M9 plate
	* Anuradha streaked 1 LB plate and 1 M9 plate
	* Plates put at 28 °C

# 03/07/2019
* 9.30 am: streaked *E. coli* K12 MG1655  from the stock at -80°C in position IIIA1-22 and * E. coli* B REL606 form the stock in position IIIA1-14 with Gunda
	* I streked 2 LB plates and 2 M9 plates (1 for each strain)
	* Gunda streaked 2 LB plates and 2 M9 plates (1 for each strain)
	* Plates put at 28 °C
* I tried to write the primers for discrimitating the strains by myself 

# 04/07/2019
* 9.00 am: Put all the cultures in 4 mL of LB/M9 at the appropriate temperature (28/37°C, 200rpm)
	* Labeled all the dilution plates for tomorrow, put glass beads inside
	* Put glycerol in vials for tomorrow, vials labeled
	* Put plates with streaks of the strains at 4°C
* Checked primers with Gocke: need to change something because I did not check for partial matches
* Afternoon: I have rewritten the primers and sent them to Gocke

# 05/07/2019
* Medium controls for the O/N cultures look all clean, cultures are all well grown except for SBW25-1 M9 (nothing visible) and SBW25-2 M9 (really faint)
* 9.00 am: inoculated all the glycerol stocks except for SBW25-1 M9, which did not show any growth
	* Stocks put at -80°C in the bottom shelf
	* Overnight cultures put at 4°C
	* SBW25-1 M9 put back at 28°C
* 10.15 am: meeting with Arne
	* We decided to talk to other theory people to discuss the modelling part
* 11.30 am: inoculation of the long term cultures (4 mL of LB or M9) with 4 $\mu$L of the overnight cultures
	* 05/07/19 is my day 0 (D0) of the long term experiment)
	* Long term cultures are labeled as strain(SBW25/MG1655/REL606)-sample(1-3, 1-6 for REL606) medium(LB/M9)
		* LB is labeled in black, M9 in blue
	* Long term cultures put at 28/37°C as appropriate
	* Overnight cultures put back at 4°C
	* SBW25-1 M9 seems to show an incredibly faint cloudiness, I decided to use it to inoculate the respective long term culture
		* I will wait this afternoon for making the glycerol stock 
	* Long term cultures put at the 28/37°C with MCs, SBW25-1 M9 put at 28°C
* 5 pm: SBW25-1 M9 shows visible growth
	* Glycerol stock inoculated and put at -80°C
	* Stocks are labeled with the date (05/07/19), medium, strain, sample number, day of the experiment (D0), my initials (SP)
	* LB vials labeled in black and M9 vials in blue
* Inoculated all the dilution plates (52 plates) with 100 $\mu$L taken from the respective dilution of the O/N cultures in Ringer's (D0 dilution plates)
	* There are 2 plates for each sample, at different dilutions (10^-7 and 10^-6 for LB, 10^-6 and 10^-5 for M9)
	* 3 SBW25 LB samples (1-3), 3 MG1655 LB samples (1-3), 6 REL606 LB samples (1-6)
	* 3 SBW25 M9 samples (1-3), 3 MG1655 M9 samples (1-3), 6 REL606 M9 samples (1-6)
	* Medium controls for LB and M9, at 28°C and 37°C (4 in total)

# 06/07/2019
* Counted the dilution plates for *E. coli*, and put at 4°C

# 07/07/2019
* Counted the dilution plates for *P. fluorescens*, and put at 4°C
* Plate SBW25-2 LB D0 $10^{-7}$ contaminated with green mould
	* Put parafilm around it to avoid spreading of spores
* Created spreadsheets for glycerol stock and dilution plates
* SBW25 did not produce many colonies in LB (10^-7 and 10^-6 dilutions)
	* Next time I will try with 10^-6 and 10^-5
* CFU/mL in the D0 O/N cultures used for inoculating the long term cultures

* Put glycerol on the cryovials for tomorrow (10/07/19), beads in the labeled plates and medium (2 mL) in the tubes for the O/N cultures

# 10/07/2019
* This is my D5
* Dilutions of the LTSP tubes in 2 96-wells [1 for LB and 1 for M9] plates in the following way
	* $10^{-1}$ -> 5 $\mu$L culture in 45 $\mu$L Ringer's
	* Other steps -> 20 $\mu$L previous step in 180 $\mu$L Ringer's
	* MC -> 5 $\mu$L MC in 45 $\mu$L Ringer's
* Dilution plates
	* Check the dilutions!
	* Plated 100 $\mu$L from the respective dilutions for the cultures
	* Plated 50 $\mu$L from the $10^{-1}$ dilution for MC [the total volume!]
	* SBW25 LB -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* SBW25 M9 -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* MG1655 LB -> plated $10^{-7}$, $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* MG1655 M9 -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* REL606 LB -> plated $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* REL606 M9 -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
* O/N cultures for the D5 glycerol stocks
	* 2 $\mu$L of the LTSP culture in 2 mL medium
* LTSP cultures brought back to 4 mL (added 0-500 $\mu$L mq$H_2O$ upon necessity)
* Since some spare tubes with medium were available, inoculated them with mq$H_2O$ to test for contamination
	* 1 LB tube put at 28°C, 1 M9 tube put at 37°C

# 11/07/2019
* The plate MC LB 37°C D5 is contaminated
	* The tube itself looks clean
	* I have plated its $10^{-1}$ dilution, and it has 112 colonies that look like MG1655
	* The dilution plates of MG1655 and REL606 at $10^{-7}$ look fine, with 3-5 colonies each, far fewer than the MC
	* I think the contamination could come from the dilution step, or a wrong plating
	* I have plated again 50 $\mu$L form the LTSP MC LB 37°C on an LB plate
	* I have washed the well in the 96 plate that I have used for inoculating the MC plate with 100 $\mu$L Ringer's, and used them for inoculating another LB plate
	* Tomorrow I will see if these too gets contaminated
* MG1655-1 LB is contaminated with a patina in both dilutions ($10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$), and the same is true for REL606-4 LB $10^{-6}$
	* Colonies are still visible, and I have counted MG1655-1 LB $10^{-5}$ since it was the only countable one for that replicate
	* The plate MC M9 37°C is clean
* Counted *E. coli* D5 plates
* REL606 in LB shows small colonies alongside the normal ones in all the replicates, which are absent from MG1655
	* The small colonies have more defined margins
	* I took 2 pictures with the microscope and showed them to Jenna, we will have a look at them tomorrow
* CFU/mL in the D5 cultures
