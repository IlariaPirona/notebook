	* I streked 1 LB plate and 1 M9 plate
	* Anuradha streaked 1 LB plate and 1 M9 plate
	* Plates put at 28 °C

# 03/07/2019
* 9.30 am: streaked *E. coli* K12 MG1655  from the stock at -80°C in position IIIA1-22 and * E. coli* B REL606 form the stock in position IIIA1-14 with Gunda
	* I streked 2 LB plates and 2 M9 plates (1 for each strain)

	* Labeled all the dilution plates for tomorrow, put glass beads inside
	* Put glycerol in vials for tomorrow, vials labeled
	* Put plates with streaks of the strains at 4°C
* Checked primers with Gocke: need to change something because I did not check for partial matches
* Afternoon: I have rewritten the primers and sent them to Gocke

# 05/07/2019
* Medium controls for the O/N cultures look all clean, cultures are all well grown except for SBW25-1 M9 (nothing visible) and SBW25-2 M9 (really faint)
* 9.00 am: inoculated all the glycerol stocks except for SBW25-1 M9, which did not show any growth

# 09/07/2019
* Put glycerol on the cryovials for tomorrow (10/07/19), beads in the labeled plates and medium (2 mL) in the tubes for the O/N cultures

# 10/07/2019
* This is my D5
* Dilutions of the LTSP tubes in 2 96-wells [1 for LB and 1 for M9] plates in the following way
	* $10^{-1}$ -> 5 $\mu$L culture in 45 $\mu$L Ringer's
	* Other steps -> 20 $\mu$L previous step in 180 $\mu$L Ringer's
	* MC -> 5 $\mu$L MC in 45 $\mu$L Ringer's
* Dilution plates
	* Check the dilutions!
	* Plated 100 $\mu$L from the respective dilutions for the cultures
	* Plated 50 $\mu$L from the $10^{-1}$ dilution for MC [the total volume!]
	* SBW25 LB -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* SBW25 M9 -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* MG1655 LB -> plated $10^{-7}$, $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* MG1655 M9 -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* REL606 LB -> plated $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$
	* REL606 M9 -> plated $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$
* O/N cultures for the D5 glycerol stocks
	* 2 $\mu$L of the LTSP culture in 2 mL medium
* LTSP cultures brought back to 4 mL (added 0-500 $\mu$L mq$H_2O$ upon necessity)
* Since some spare tubes with medium were available, inoculated them with mq$H_2O$ to test for contamination
	* 1 LB tube put at 28°C, 1 M9 tube put at 37°C

# 11/07/2019
* The plate MC LB 37°C D5 is contaminated
	* The tube itself looks clean
	* I have plated its $10^{-1}$ dilution, and it has 112 colonies that look like MG1655
	* The dilution plates of MG1655 and REL606 at $10^{-7}$ look fine, with 3-5 colonies each, far fewer than the MC
	* I think the contamination could come from the dilution step, or a wrong plating
	* I have plated again 50 $\mu$L form the LTSP MC LB 37°C on an LB plate
	* I have washed the well in the 96 plate that I have used for inoculating the MC plate with 100 $\mu$L Ringer's, and used them for inoculating another LB plate
	* Tomorrow I will see if these too gets contaminated
* MG1655-1 LB is contaminated with a patina (bead tracks) in both dilutions ($10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$), and the same is true for REL606-4 LB $10^{-6}$
	* Colonies are still visible, and I have counted MG1655-1 LB $10^{-5}$ since it was the only countable one for that replicate
	* The plate MC M9 37°C is clean
* Counted *E. coli* D5 plates
* REL606 in LB shows small colonies alongside the normal ones in all the replicates, which are absent from MG1655
	* The small colonies have more defined margins
	* I took 2 pictures with the microscope and showed them to Jenna, we will have a look at them tomorrow
	* Jenna said that they look like contamination, but it is unlikely that I have contaminated all the REL606 replicates
	* At the microscope with India Ink they look like bacteria, but are smaller than the ones from the normal colonies
		* Not motile, as expected for REL606
		* We will test with the primers when they arrive
* Inoculated the glycerol stocks with 1 mL of the respective O/N cultures, and put at -80°C

# 12/07/2019
* Counted *P. fluorescens* D5 plates
* The replica plating of 50 $\mu$L of $10^{-1}$ MC LB 37°C is clean, while the plate obtained by washing the well used for the MC LB 37°C D5 plate (which was contaminated) with 100 $\mu$L Ringer's shows the same contamination
	* I conclude that the contamination came from the dilution step, so I can ignore it
* SBW25-3 LB $10^{-6}$ shows what I think is a wrinkly spreader
* SBW25-2 LB $10^{-6}$ has a bacterial patina (bead tracks) and is uncountable
* Wrinkly spreaders appeared in LB
	* SBW25-2 LB $10^{-5}$ has 5 big WS
	* SBW25-3 LB $10^{-6}$ has 1 small WS, $10^{-5}$ has 2 small WS
* CFU/mL in the D5 cultures

* Initial considerations looking at the CFU/mL at D0 and D5
	* M9 has consistently higher readings than LB at D5 for all strains
		* Probably because in M9 cells are smaller, so more of them can grow in the same volume
	* Readings at D5 are much more consistent than at D0
	* MG1655 is consistently decreasing from D0 to D5
	* REL606 is slowly decreasing in LB, and stationary in M9
	* SBW25 is stationary in LB, and increasing (!) consistently in M9
		* It started lower, so it is maybe just normalizing
* The LTSP cultures were moved to the 28°C room in a static rack at 3 pm of Friday
	* This would be D8 at 3pm
* 3 pm: LTSP cultures moved to 28°C room in a static rack because of the power outage

# 13/07/2019
* 11 pm: LTSP cultures moved back to the shakers because the power outage is over

# 15/07/2019
* We will make dilutions and stocks on D10 (wednesday), D12 (friday) D15 (monday) and D17 (wednesday) because we are near the supposed death of REL606 (D16)
* Labeled all the dilution plates, tubes and criovials for D10 and D12
* Put medium in D10 tubes and glycerol in criovials
* Made O/N cultures in 2 mL LB from stocks of SBW25 (IIIA1-5), MG1655 (IIIA1-22) and REL606 (IIIA1-14) for extracting genomic DNA to be used in the test PCR
* I made a mistake on the labels: what I considered D10 is actually D12, and D12 is D14
	* Tomorrow I will correct it in RED ink in the plates, and with the same ink used for the stocks

# 16/07/2019
* The primers (SBW25_unique1_fw, SBW25_unique1_rv, MG1655_unique1_fw, MG1655_unique1_rv, REL606_unique1_fw, REL606_unique1_rv) have arrived
	* Made stock solution 100 $\mu$M
	* Made working stock 5 $\mu$M (10$\mu$L of stock in 200 $\mu$L total)
* Extracted genomic DNA from O/N cultures of SBW25, MG1655 and REL606
	* 1.5 mL eppis put at -20°C in my rack
* I made a test PCR for the primers
	* 94°C 10'+30*(94°C 30''+60°C 30''+72°C 1')+72°C 5'
	* Samples labeled A1, A2, A3, A0, B1, B2, B3, B0, C1, C2, C3, C0
		* A -> SBW25 specific primers
		* B -> MG1655 specific primers
		* C -> REL606 specific primers
		* 1 -> SBW25 genomic DNA as a template
		* 2 -> MG16555 genomic DNA as a template
		* 3 -> REL606 genomic DNA as a template
		* 0 -> no template ($H_2O$)
	* Samples run in the following order in a 50 mL 1% gel, for 45 minutes at 80V
		* Ladder A1 A2 A3 A0 B1 B2 B3 B0 C1 C2 C3 C0 Ladder Empty
	* The bands look as expected, the primers work
		* Gel image saved as 16-07-19_img1.pdf
* Label of the D12 (ex D10) plates corrected with red marker
* Label of the D14 (ex D12) plates corrected with various markers because it did not write well
* D10 (actually D12) and D12 (actually D14) tubes not corrected because they will never be mixed up
* Glycerol stocks of D12 (ex D10) and D14 (ex D12) corrected with the same ink used

# 17/07/2019
* Inoculated O/N tubes for D12
* Inoculated dilution plates D12
* Put medium in the D14 O/N tubes

		* Both small colonies and big colonies are positive, the positive and negative control are as expected
		* Image of the gel saved as 17-07-19_img1.pdf
* Counted the number of small colonies and big colonies in the D5 plates (REL606 $10^{-5}$)

# 18/07/2019
* Inoculated glycerol vials with D12 O/N
* Counted *E. coli* D12 dilution plates
* In REL606 LB the small colonies are now (D12) the vast majority
	* There are also some very tiny colonies, much smaller than the small ones (see REL606 LB D12 pictures)
* Small colonies begun to appear in MG1655 LB
	* The distinction between small and big is less clear than in REL606
	* MG1655-1 big->45 small->0
		* The $10^{-5}$ dilution had 387 colonies, of which around 70 were small (difficult to count the exact number)
	* Mg1655-2 big->22 small->12
	* Mg1655-3 big->21 small->21
* Jenna proposed to do a NGS project with hers 6-months old *P. fluorescens* samples
	* The samples are called Pf longterm 1-4
		* Pf longterm 1 should be large colony, smooth, fluorescent
		* Pf longterm 2 should be small colony, smooth
		* Pf longterm 3 should be very small colony, smooth
		* Pf longterm 4 should be medium-sized colony, possible colanic acid switcher
	* They should be stored in IIIA3 29-32 but they are actually in IIIA3 24-28 (?, check)
	* I have streaked them on LB plates, but I will probably streak them again on saturday so to be able to put the overnights on monday and do a genomic extraction on tuesday
* Labeled D17 plates and O/N tubes

# 19/07/2019
* Inoculated plates and tubes D14
* Prepared vials D17
* Read D12 SBW25 plates
* Updated the number of colonies in *E. coli* M9 D12, since many colonies were small and not visible yestarday
* Still no diversity in M9 for all of the strains, in LB SBW25 shown many WS, big and small

# 20/07/2019
* Inoculated D14 glycerol stocks
* Prepared D17 tubes
* Put *E. coli* D14 plates in the fridge

# 21/07/2019
* Counted D14 plates

# 22/07/2019
* Inoculated D17 plates and O/N tubes

| Template   | $MgCl_2$ (5x) | Buffer green (10x) | CES 5x   | dNTPs    | SBW25 FW | SBW25 RV | GoTaq      | $H_2O$   | TOT       |
|------------|---------------|--------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|------------|----------|-----------|

* I have checked by PCR a single colony from each Pf longterm sample (1-4) with SBW25-specific primers
	* The sample was obtained by touching a pipette tip on the colony and rinsing it in 20 $\mu$L of sterile Ringer's in a 96 well
		* 0.5 $\mu$L of this suspension were used as a template in the PCR
	* 94°C 10'+30*(94°C 30''+60°C 30''+72°C 1')+72°C 5'
	* Used SBW25 genomic DNA as a positive control and Ringer's as a negative control
	* Run as Ladder(100bp)-1-2-3-4-Ctr+-Ctr-
	* All samples are positive, controls as expected
	* Gel in 22-07-2019_img1
* I have set up the O/N cultures for Pf longterm 1-4, for genomic extraction
	* The cultures are done in 4 mL LB in 13 mL tubes
	* The tubes were inoculated with 2 $\mu$L of the suspension used for the PCR

# 23/07/2019
* I have counted the D17 *E. coli* plates
	* MG1655 in M9 is going down sharply, next time I will plate $10^{-4}$, $10^{-2}$, $10^{0}$
	* MG1655-2 M9 is extremely high compared to the other replicates (100 fold)
		* This is consistent in both the dilution plates
		* Also the OD of the O/N tube is visibly different
			* MG1655-1 and -3 M9 do not show any visible growth in the O/N tube, but MG1655-2 M9 does
* Michael Lachmann talk on the origin of life
	* Selection can happen in absence of reproduction

# 24/07/2019
* Inoculated the tubes and plates for D19
* I have counted the D17 *P. fluorescens* plates
* Michael Lachmann talk on plasticity
	* Genomes do not encode the whole phenotype
	* Phenotype is partially encoded by the environment
	* The genome has an optimal nuber of parameters for modelling a phenomenon, so to give smart responses and avoid overfitting

# 25/07/2019
* MG1655 in M9 shows a marked decreas in CFU/mL, and replicate 2 is much more viable than the other replicates
	* I plated all the MG1655 M9 in LB plates to check if they develop different colony morphologies, especially MG1655-2
		* I plated 100 $\mu$L of $10^{-4}$ for replicate 2, and $10^{-1}$ for the others
* I counted the *E. coli* plates for D19
	* Some colonies in M9 plates (MG1655) are still too small to be counted, will do that tomorrow
* I will not be here on the weekend, so I will do next plating on monday (D24)

# 26/07/2019
* Counted all of the D19 plates
* Next plating will be done in D24
* Some colonies in SBW25 look weird
	* Color is less intense, they are rounder, smaller
* I made a PCR for testing some colonies of MG1655 M9 plated on LB and for the strange SBW25 LB colonies
	* The 3 MG1655 M9 colonies tested are positive, they are MG1655
	* The SBW25 LB colonies are all positive, except for 1 (colony B1 on the plate)
	* I have also tested the Pf longterm genomic DNA with the respective primers (all positive)
	* I have used one MG1655 colony as a control for the SBW25-specific primers and vice-versa
	* Template vas obtained from a 20 $\mu$ suspension of the colony in mq$H_2O$
	* See 26-07-2019_img1
	* I have used 0.5 $\mu$L of template in every case
	* One of the small SBW25 colonies (marked as B1 on the plate) is negative
		* Could be an error in picking the colony?

# 29/07/2019
* Inoculated D24 tubes and plates
	* I have plated/made stocks of only the REL606 (LB + M9) and MG1655 M9
* Prepared ggplot graphs for the meeting with Jenna

# 30/07/2019
* Meeting with Jenna
	* The results are interesting, although different from what we expected
	* The WGS part of the project will probably begin in 2 weeks
		* In the meantime I should install breseq and learn how it works
	* We will plate every 2-3 days from now on
* Counted D24 plates
* Prepared D26 tubes and plates
* Genomic DNA of Pf longterm (1-4) run in an 1% agarose gel 90V 1h by Anuradha (5 $\mu$L)
	* It shows a sharp band above 10 kb, I will ask Jenna if it can be genomic
	* Saved as 30-07-2019_img1.bmp

# 31/07/2019
* Inoculated tubes and plates D26

# 01/08/2019
* Prepared tubes and plates D28
* Counted MG1655 LB plates D26
* REL606 LB $10^[-3]$ has too many colonies to be counted, but they are really small and less than on D24
* The other plates need to grow more, will count them tomorrow
* In M9 there is essentially nothing in all the plates
	* Since it is a new batch, to check wether there is a problem with the medium I poured 1 mL of O/N REL606 with visible growth in 2 clean M9 plates (1 for each batch)
* Initiated box 3 for the glycerol stocks
* I started updating the glycerol stock spreadsheet
