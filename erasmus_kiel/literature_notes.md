# Preliminary notes
* REL606 is supposed to become senescent after 16 days [@Bacun-Druzina2007], and this has been confirmed by a previous experiment made by Jenna

# Abbreviations
* LTSP: long term stationary phase

# Stationary phase [Ksiazek2010]
* 

# [@Westphal2018]
* Attenuation of RpoS is strongly selected at the begenning (after 1 day) in *E. coli*
* Mutations in *rho* and *rpoBC* (regulatory proteins) are favoured in LTSP
* The GASP phenotype does not appear in Terrific broth or Super borth (even a disadvantage appears!), but cells aged in them show GASP if transfeered to LB

# Differences between MG1655 and REL606 [@Yoon2012]
* Only 4% of the genome is strain-specific 
* It includes profages and recently transferred islands
* REL606 has an additional set of Type II secretion genes and D-arabinose utilization
* REL606 lacks the cluster *fly* for flagellar biosythesis and the very short patch repair system
* Different set of genes for the Qin prophage, O-antigen synthesis, catabolism of aromatic compounds, LPS oligosaccharide synthesis
	* REL606 has the *hpa* cluster for catabolism of 3- and 4-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid
	* MG1655 has the *paa* cluster for catabolism of phenyl acetic acid
* There are numerous gene disruptions caused by deletions, frameshifts, IS sequences
* The 2 strains grow similarly in LB but REL606 grows faster in minimal medium
* Negligible differences in the accumulation of byproducts in minimal vs complex medium
* At the trascription level, in REL606 highly expressed genes are those involved in replication, translation and nucleotide metabolism, while in MG1655 genes for motility, transcription and energy production
* Proteins that are more abundant in REL606 are those involved in amino acid biosynthesis and maltose metabolism
* On the contrary, in MG1655 are more abundant protein for amino acid degradation and stress-response
* REL606 releases more proteins in the medium in stationary phase
* REL606 is more susceptible to stressfull conditions caused by osmolarity, pH, salicylate and $\beta$-lactam antibiotics
