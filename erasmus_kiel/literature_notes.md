* REL606 is supposed to become senescent after 16 days [@Bacun-Druzina2007], and this has been confirmed by a previous experiment made by Jenna
* Attenuation of RpoS is strongly selected at the begenning (after 1 day) in *E. coli* [@Westphal2018]
* Should be favoured also mutations in rho and rpoBC, regulatory proteins
* The GASP phenotype does not appear in Terrific broth or Super borth (even a disadvantage appears!), but cells aged in them show GASP if transfeered to LB
