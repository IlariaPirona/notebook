# Preliminary notes
* REL606 is supposed to become senescent after 16 days [@Ksiazek2010] (I have not found this in the paper, look deeper), and this has been confirmed by a previous experiment made by Jenna

# Abbreviations
* LTSP: long term stationary phase
* GASP: growth advantage in stationary phase

# Bacterial aging [@Ksiazek2010]
* Aging is a set of changes that impair the ability to maintain homeostasis
* In human somatic cells aging is manifested as inability to divide (replicative senescence)
	* The maximum number of times a cell can divide is given by the Hayflick limit
	* It does not depend on the cronological time
	* Senescence can be triggered with stressors (SIPS, stress induced premature senescence)
* Also *S. cerevisiae* shows senescence, probably mediated by the accumulation of cytoplasmic factors
* The main way of bacterial replication is binary fission, which is a simmetric process mediated by FtsZ
	* This simmetry has been traditionally considered as a proof that bacteria do not age
	* The simmetry of division in *E. coli* is not reflected at the level of cellullar organization
	* One of the daughter cells inherits pre-existing elements from the mother (old pole) while the other synthesizes these *de novo* (new pole)
	* The linear discendence of the old pole shows senescence, and its replicative lifespan is of about 100 divisions
	* The old pole elements are likely damaged DNA and proteins and fragments of cell wall
* In their natural environment, usually bacteria are in nutrient starvation and enter in a stationary phase until conditions improve
* In stationary phase, cell division and death are balanced, while in death fase cell death exceeds cell division
* In stationary phase *E. coli* has chromosomes compacted by the induction of Dps, and ribosomes dimerized (inactive) because of the activation of rmf mediated by ppGpp
	* There is also a change in cell size and morphology
	* Cells become smaller and more spherical mainly because of RpoS activation
		* This is mediated by action on *bolA* and *ftsQAZ*
	* These changes are permanent even after bacteria are transferred to a nutrient-rich environment
* *E. coli* cells are made senescent by staying in stationary phase for 16 days
	* Expression of genes regulating carbohydrate metabolism, energy generation and macromolecule synthesis(*sdhA*, *cydA*, *cydB*, *murI*) is dowregulated
	* There is accumulation of aberrant proteins, that begins in exponential phase
* Loss of culturability in senescente cells can be reversed by reducing oxygen pressure (!)* Loss of culturability in senescente cells can be reversed by reducing oxygen pressure (!)

# [@Westphal2018]
* Attenuation of RpoS is strongly selected at the begenning (after 1 day) in *E. coli*
* Mutations in *rho* and *rpoBC* (regulatory proteins) are favoured in LTSP
* The GASP phenotype does not appear in Terrific broth or Super borth (even a disadvantage appears!), but cells aged in them show GASP if transfeered to LB

# Differences between MG1655 and REL606 [@Yoon2012]
* Only 4% of the genome is strain-specific 
* It includes profages and recently transferred islands
* REL606 has an additional set of Type II secretion genes and D-arabinose utilization
* REL606 lacks the cluster *fly* for flagellar biosythesis and the very short patch repair system
* Different set of genes for the Qin prophage, O-antigen synthesis, catabolism of aromatic compounds, LPS oligosaccharide synthesis
	* REL606 has the *hpa* cluster for catabolism of 3- and 4-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid
	* MG1655 has the *paa* cluster for catabolism of phenyl acetic acid
* There are numerous gene disruptions caused by deletions, frameshifts, IS sequences
* The 2 strains grow similarly in LB but REL606 grows faster in minimal medium
* Negligible differences in the accumulation of byproducts in minimal vs complex medium
* At the trascription level, in REL606 highly expressed genes are those involved in replication, translation and nucleotide metabolism, while in MG1655 genes for motility, transcription and energy production
* Proteins that are more abundant in REL606 are those involved in amino acid biosynthesis and maltose metabolism
* On the contrary, in MG1655 are more abundant protein for amino acid degradation and stress-response
* REL606 releases more proteins in the medium in stationary phase
* REL606 is more susceptible to stressfull conditions caused by osmolarity, pH, salicylate and $\beta$-lactam antibiotics
